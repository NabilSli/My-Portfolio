# 😃 My Portfolio.

This website is my first as a web developer👏. I did it during my OpenClassroom's boot camp to become a Web developer.

## ⭐️ Use the full range of knowledge acquired during the courses.

To realise this project there was some technical skill required, such as:

- 🎯 `HTML`
  - Build the page using the right tags
  - Dividing the page into blocks from the wireframe to ensure a responsive design
  - Search engine optimization: use proper `HTML` semantics, fill `alt` properties
  - Code quality practices: write comments and indent code to make it maintainable and readable
  - Factorize with the right css class in order to not repeat the same code multiple time
- 📚 `CSS`

  - Hierachise the code, starting with the desktop view as we are in a desktop-first project, going top to bottom and from the bigger to the smaller view
  - Use atomic classes to avoid repetition
  - Use media query's to ensure reponsive design
  - Use `flexbox` and/or `grid`
  - Use Sass library

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 `GIT`
  - Use `git` for versioning
  - Create branches and open pull requests for each new feature
  - Get reviewed and apply proper corrections
- ✂️ `JavaScript`

  - Create functions to fetch data and show it dynamically
  - Build the page from scripts
  - Use useState and UseEffect to rerender parts of the website only when needed
  - Show PDF documents online
  - Add a service to send emails to my email account

- 🔨 `React`
  - Divide every part of the page in components to call and reuse on demand
  - Use react-router to create multiple pages and link them together
  - Build pages by using components and the props needed
  - Use the JS functions to modify the components dynamically
